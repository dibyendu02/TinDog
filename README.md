**TinDog**

TinDog is a website where dogs can find their perfect match. I have used HTML,CSS and Bootsrap to make this website. I have learnt some core concepts of CSS like Grid , Media Query Breakpoints, Selector's property while making this project. An Udemy course guided me while doing this project.
